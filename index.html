          Often considered the greatest artist of all time, Michelangelo was a
          sculptor and painter from the Florentine Republic, operating from
          around 1490 until his death in 1564.
        </p>

          His most famous works include <em>David</em>, a sculpture completed
          between 1501 and 1504 for the Florentine Republic, and the
          <em>Sistine Chapel ceiling</em>, painted between 1508 and 1512.
